This project is a Data Visualization project.
The dataset on Currency Exchange Rate of different countries is provided.
The dataset needs to be visualized in the best possible manner(s).

The main aim of this project is to make the data understandable to read for the people using different graphs.

In this project we have added 2 types of graphs.
First is the comparison between the Developed and Developing Countries' Exchange Rate.
The second graph is used to make comparisons between the Exchange Rates of any 2 countries at any particular year(given in the dataset). The graph offers 3 dropdown menus to select the countries and the year.
